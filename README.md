# Requirements
Python 3.6



# Overview
RiceBioS is an AI-based (deep learning-enabled) handheld device for real-time identification of biotic stress in rice crops using the computational capabilities
of handheld devices. RiceBioS adopts Edge-as-a-Service (EaaS) as an approach for classifying rice crop images into two categories â€“- healthy and stressed. 
The biotic stress condition is further diagnosed into two types of infections, fungal (rice blast) and bacterial (bacterial leaf blight of rice) by pruning the 
shrunk deep learning classification model and incorporating an automated RoI detection and feature extraction workflow, which makes use of adaptive thresholding 
and hierarchial masking techniques to perform dimensionality reduction. 

While RiceBioS demonstrates a test accuracy of 93.25%, it exhibits a negligible tradeoff on a smartphone after deployment. This cutting edge solution helps the 
farmers make informed decisions based on real-time insights provided by the user-friendly mobile application interface of RiceBioS.
